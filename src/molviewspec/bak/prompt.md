For the attached OpenAPI spec I'd like you you help me generate RUST code that can consume and generate that spec. This can include:

- Creating Rust structs that represent the components of my API spec.
- Implement serialization and deserialization using serde.
- Create builder patterns for complex objects where appropriate.
- Implement validation logic based on the constraints in your spec.
- Provide a way to generate the full OpenAPI spec from these Rust structures.

Here is the spec:
